### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my startup [StepSecurity](https://www.stepsecurity.io), to thwart software supply chain attacks
    
     I was a Principal Security Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft, and used to lead the [Green Team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/the-green-team-solves-high-risk-systemic-security-issues-for-azure/), to solve high-risk systemic security issues in Azure.
     
     In 2006, I had won an All-India contest organized by Microsoft called the [Security Shootout Contest](https://www.ciol.com/microsoft-announces-winners-security-shootout-1/), in which 11,200 developers participated, and for which an SUV was the first prize!
